                <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
                <p>In early 2024, I embarked on a mission to create something that would change the landscape of math education for children facing learning challenges. What started as a vision to help children with math anxiety and dyscalculia has grown into a movement that reaches thousands of learners across diverse communities.</p>

                <h2>Rigorous Testing & Iteration</h2>
                <p>Over the last almost two years, the app has undergone extensive development and refinement. I've had the privilege of testing it with <strong>90+ neurodiverse children</strong> at local special schools, working with students who have autism, ADHD, and Down syndrome. Each interaction provided invaluable insights that shaped the app into what it is today.</p>

                <p>The feedback from these real-world tests was instrumental in creating an experience that truly resonates with children. Watching students engage with the app, seeing their confidence grow, and observing their improved numeracy skills reinforced the importance of this mission.</p>

                <h2>Expert Collaboration</h2>
                <p>Beyond student testing, I connected with numerous psychologists and psychiatrists through LinkedIn and other professional networks. These dedicated professionals provided critical expertise, helping to refine the therapeutic aspects of the app and ensure it meets the highest standards for supporting children with learning differences. Their guidance was invaluable in creating a tool that is both clinically sound and genuinely effective.</p>

                <h2>Launching as a Nonprofit</h2>
                <p>Recognizing the urgent need for accessible math education tools, the final version was launched as a nonprofit organization—<strong>GanitAI</strong>—with a clear mission: to introduce math learning in local public schools and underserved areas. Our focus has been on reaching children in communities like bastis (slum areas) where kids often lack access to quality teachers and educational resources.</p>

                <h2>Accessibility at the Core</h2>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of GanitAI is its accessibility. The app can run on any basic Android smartphone, eliminating the barrier of expensive devices or high-end technology. This design philosophy ensures that children from all economic backgrounds can benefit from quality math education. By providing a fun, gamified way to improve numeracy, we're breaking down the walls that have traditionally prevented many children from developing strong math skills.</p>

                <h2>Enhancing Teaching and Learning Experiences</h2>
                <p>The impact of GanitAI extends beyond individual students to transform entire learning environments. Teachers report that the app provides them with powerful tools to support diverse learners, enhancing their ability to deliver quality education. The gamified approach not only improves student engagement but also creates more dynamic and effective teaching experiences. By tracking progress and adapting to each child's needs, GanitAI empowers educators to provide personalized, high-quality instruction.</p>

                <h2>The Ripple Effect: Quality Education for All</h2>
                <p>Today, GanitAI continues to expand its reach, touching the lives of students across diverse communities. Every child who gains confidence in math, every teacher who finds a new tool to support their students, and every parent who sees their child's potential unlocked represents another step toward our vision: a world where quality education is accessible to all, promoting lifelong learning regardless of background or learning challenges.</p>

                <p>The journey has been incredible, and it's just beginning. With continued support and development, GanitAI will continue to transform the educational landscape, improving access to education and enhancing teaching and learning experiences, one child at a time.</p>
