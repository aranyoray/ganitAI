                <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
                <p>In early 2024, I embarked on a mission to create something that would change the landscape of math education for children facing learning challenges. What started as a vision to help children with math anxiety and dyscalculia has grown into a movement that reaches thousands of learners across diverse communities.</p>

                    <div class="media-caption">Testing Ganit 2024</div>
                </div>

                <h2>Rigorous Testing & Iteration</h2>
                <p>Over the last almost two years, the app has undergone extensive development and refinement. I've had the privilege of testing it with <strong>90+ neurodiverse children</strong> at local special schools, working with students who have autism, ADHD, and Down syndrome. Each interaction provided invaluable insights that shaped the app into what it is today.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The feedback from these real-world tests was instrumental in creating an experience that truly resonates with children. Watching students engage with the app, seeing their confidence grow, and observing their improved numeracy skills reinforced the importance of this mission.</p>

                <h2>Expert Collaboration</h2>
                <p>Beyond student testing, I connected with numerous psychologists and psychiatrists through LinkedIn and other professional networks. These dedicated professionals provided critical expertise, helping to refine the therapeutic aspects of the app and ensure it meets the highest standards for supporting children with learning differences. Their guidance was invaluable in creating a tool that is both clinically sound and genuinely effective.</p>

                <p>Dr. Rajarshi Mitra, a clinical psychologist specializing in learning disorders at Medica Superspecialty Hospital, played a crucial role in advising on measurement domains for numerical comprehension, working memory, and procedural accuracy. His expertise in evidence-based assessment criteria helped shape GanitAI into a tool that systematically strengthens calculation fluency, conceptual reasoning, and procedural accuracy. The app helps reduce math anxiety by encouraging low-pressure engagement and immediate positive reinforcement, creating measurable gains in both performance and confidence among users.</p>

                <p>Working with experienced educators like Mrs. Chaitali Dasgupta, Head of Mathematics at South City International School, ensured that the game content aligns with curriculum standards. Her over twenty years of teaching experience helped identify the value of this approach for children who find mathematics intimidating. She guided the alignment of game content with the curriculum and observed pilot sessions, recognizing how the project combines sound pedagogy with a genuine desire to reach learners left behind.</p>

                <h2>Launching as a Nonprofit</h2>
                <p>Recognizing the urgent need for accessible math education tools, the final version was launched as a nonprofit organization—<strong>GanitAI</strong>—with a clear mission: to introduce math learning in local public schools and underserved areas. Our focus has been on reaching children in communities like bastis (slum areas) where kids often lack access to quality teachers and educational resources.</p>

                <p>The initiative has received recognition from educational institutions, with South City International School's Acting Principal, Ms. Rupika Nath, acknowledging the exceptional contribution and remarkable impact. The app has been successfully piloted at multiple locations including Al-Islamia Primary School in Park Circus, various grade levels at South City International School, and in collaboration with organizations like the Krita Foundation, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse learning environments.</p>

                <h2>Accessibility at the Core</h2>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of GanitAI is its accessibility. The app can run on any basic Android smartphone, eliminating the barrier of expensive devices or high-end technology. This design philosophy ensures that children from all economic backgrounds can benefit from quality math education. By providing a fun, gamified way to improve numeracy, we're breaking down the walls that have traditionally prevented many children from developing strong math skills.</p>

                <h2>Enhancing Teaching and Learning Experiences</h2>
                <p>The impact of GanitAI extends beyond individual students to transform entire learning environments. Teachers report that the app provides them with powerful tools to support diverse learners, enhancing their ability to deliver quality education. The gamified approach not only improves student engagement but also creates more dynamic and effective teaching experiences. By tracking progress and adapting to each child's needs, GanitAI empowers educators to provide personalized, high-quality instruction.</p>

                <p>At South City International School, the app has made a remarkable difference in the learning experience of over 160 students across Classes 1 to 3. Testing outcomes have indicated an average <strong>35% increase in response speed</strong> and a significant rise in confidence among learners. Primary school educators have commended the innovative approach, with many exploring how to further integrate GanitAI with their lesson plans. The app's alignment with curriculum standards, guided by experienced educators like Mrs. Chaitali Dasgupta, Head of the Mathematics Department, ensures that it complements classroom learning effectively.</p>

                <h2>Transforming Student Lives: Real Stories of Success</h2>
                <p>The true impact of GanitAI is best measured through the stories of transformation we witness every day. Students who once struggled with math anxiety have found new confidence and enthusiasm for learning. Children who avoided mathematics homework now engage actively with numerical concepts. The app has been particularly effective in helping students overcome specific challenges, whether it's multiplication difficulties, fraction phobias, or general math anxiety.</p>

                <p>What makes these transformations remarkable is not just the improvement in test scores, but the restoration of belief and curiosity in children who had once accepted defeat in mathematics. Teachers report seeing improved attention spans, reduced anxiety, and increased participation in class discussions. Students who used to be terrified of certain math concepts now help their peers understand them, becoming peer tutors and demonstrating the ripple effect of restored confidence.</p>

                <h2>The Ripple Effect: Quality Education for All</h2>
                <p>Today, GanitAI continues to expand its reach, touching the lives of students across diverse communities. Every child who gains confidence in math, every teacher who finds a new tool to support their students, and every parent who sees their child's potential unlocked represents another step toward our vision: a world where quality education is accessible to all, promoting lifelong learning regardless of background or learning challenges.</p>

                <p>The journey has been incredible, and it's just beginning. With continued support and development, GanitAI will continue to transform the educational landscape, improving access to education and enhancing teaching and learning experiences, one child at a time. Our dedicated team of 24 members works tirelessly to bring quality math education to children everywhere, combining compassion with technical understanding to redefine what inclusive learning looks like in today's world.</p>
